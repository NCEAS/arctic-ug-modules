Understand how data repositories support a culture of open science 1.1.0.3 Instructors Guide View the slides here. Introduce the lesson and ask students, what are data? For reference: Wikipedia - Data are characteristics or information, usually numerical, that are collected through observation.[1] In a more technical sense, data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is a single value of a single variable. [2] MerriamWebster - Factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation Tech terms - Computer data is information processed or stored by a computer. This information may be in the form of text documents, images, audio clips, software programs, or other types of data. Dictionary.com - A plural of datum. Datum: A single piece of information, as a fact, statistic, or code; an item of data. In Philosophy 1) any fact assumed to be a matter of direct observation. 2) Any proposition assumed or given, from which conclusions may be drawn. Ask students to provide examples of data from their daily life or from their own course work. The world today is filled with science news, from climate change to hurricanes – and it all affects the people inhabiting the earth. The label “data” is all-encompassing and can be categorized in several ways. These graphics help us classify types of data. Ask students to think of some data related to any of these categories. Then to try and define a data repository. Some leading questions: Libraries store books, repositories store ____. Where does data go? What is the “cloud”? The amount of available storage is not keeping up with the amount of data flooding in daily. How do we decide what data we keep? Ask students to discuss where data from research seem to end up. Since we already introduced repositories in the earlier slide, this question is not necessarily meant to reinforce the concept. Rather, what we want the students to get at is where do they think data from research typically goes and how does that fit into the scientific process. Because researchers require time to verify data, analyze their data, and derive research conclusions, individual researchers generally are not expected to make all their data public immediately. New tools for automatically assessing the quality of data and sharing them with others can facilitate the rapid sharing of digital data, although verifying the reliability of these tools presents its own set of challenges. Once a research result is published, the norms of science—and often the terms of the research grant or contract—call for the supporting data to be accessible. Researchers may nevertheless try to keep the data private, perhaps to derive additional results without competition from others, for the exclusive use of a student or postdoctoral fellow whose career would be advanced by generating further papers, or just to avoid the effort to put the data in a usable form for others. In the worst cases, they may retain data to hide acts of research misconduct or to conceal defects in the dataset. Sometimes researchers may want to keep the data private just out of respect for the type of data collected. Some data contains sensitive information such as people’s names, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs. The norms of a research community may allow keeping data private for a certain period. These norms can be formalized through the terms of a grant-giving the investigator a defined period of exclusive use of the data, with the exclusivity ending upon the publication of results, after a particular length of time, or when data are deposited in a data center or archive. There is great variation among research fields in their data-sharing norms, to such an extent that different fields can be said to have different data cultures. Given the numerous ways data can be lost and thereby irrevocably damage the integrity and reproducibility of the associated research, this is exactly why researchers should have a plan in mind for their data. Let’s circle back to repositories now that we’ve explained the potential “why” for their use. Repositories have become a significant component of the infrastructure for research data. A repository is both a system and set of services designed as an archive for digital data with context, fixity, and persistence. In addition to data, repositories maintain and preserve metadata. Ask students to find a data repository online in groups then share their findings with the class. Good starting point here or here. Key objectives from the activity: Develop an understanding for how diverse repositories are Practice finding a repository for different data types While we might have come up with what a repository is as a class, now take a moment to explicitly define the uses of data repository. Data repositories provide: Easy information discovery Easy and efficient access More exposure and amplify impact Persistent access (through persistent URL) Long-term storage and preservation Now that we have established why using a repository is important, we want to then tie this into the philosophy of open science. Open science is the movement to make scientific research and data accessible to all. In many ways, the reasons why we should store scientific data in a repository are the same reasons why we should embrace the culture of open science. Optional Additional Materials Video on Open Science (4 minutes) TedTalk, “Open Science can save the world” (13 minutes) ACRL Presents: Open Data Repositories-Creating Equitable and Sustainable Data Access (50 minutes) An Arctic Data Center Education Module: Data Repositories+ The Arctic Data Center is a place for researchers from around the world working in the Arctic to efficiently share, discover, access, and interpret complex data about the Arctic with less effort. Part of our mission is to provide hands on training at Arctic research conferences and in dedicated training sessions targeting Arctic researchers, especially early-career and under-represented populations. In 2020, we were able to support the development of undergraduate-level educational materials through our fellowship program. These materials are open source and available for reuse and/or modification either at the associated GitHub repository, the Arctic Data Center Training page, or the DataOne Skillbuilding Hub. With over 5,700 datasets in the Arctic Data Center repository, these education modules are intended to equip students with the necessary tools and resources to unearth the story behind the data, one about one of the planet’s fastest-changing ecosystems: the Arctic. Encompassing Earth’s northern most region, the Arctic is an icy sea surrounded by land characterized by a harsh climate with extreme variation in light and temperature. Diverse landscapes—from the sea ice to coastal wetlands, upland tundra, mountains, wide rivers, and the sea itself—support abundant wildlife and many cultures making the Arctic a region like no other in the world. 1.1.1 However, what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average. The cause of such rapid warming is straightforward and well understood: It is human-caused climate change, and it is altering the relative amount of the Sun’s energy that is absorbed, reflected, or radiated in the Arctic. According to 15th annual NOAA Arctic Report Card, the sea-ice extent in October of 2020 dropped to the lowest levels on record. Dramatic drops in Arctic ice like this are the main driver for rapid Arctic changes. Effects of a warming atmosphere on physical, chemical, biological, and human components of Arctic ecosystems are myriad, far-reaching, and accelerating. There is no facet of Arctic life that will remain untouched by the immensity of these changes. Studying and understanding the Arctic is essential txo saving it, and ultimately ourselves. The Arctic Data Center repository is rich with real-world Arctic data just waiting to be explored. If you’re ready to learn how, let’s get started. 1.1.1.0.0.1 The National Wildlife Federation put together this Activity Guide if you’d like to learn more about the Arctic and climate change. "]]
